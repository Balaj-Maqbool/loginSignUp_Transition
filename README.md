# Sign-in/Sign-up Page

This is a responsive Sign-in/Sign-up page with smooth transitions between login and registration panels. The page has an interactive UI that allows users to toggle between the Sign-up and Sign-in forms with a sliding animation. The layout is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Font Awesome icons for social login options.

- **Social Login Options**: Includes social media icons (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn) as placeholders for potential OAuth login integrations.
- **Form Validation (Basic)**: Includes input fields for name, email, and password.

## Technologies Used
